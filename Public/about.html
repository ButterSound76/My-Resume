<p>Hello there and welcome to "About Me" page!!!<br /></p>
<p>I take if you are reading this you wanted to know a bit more about me:-) Well, you are in the right place for that.</p>
<p>My name is Igor Babcinetchi and I come all the way from Moldova, a small but beautiful country in Eastern Europe situated between Romania and Ukraine.
   As you could tell from reading my resume I am or rather used to be a professional musician and my musical career has taken me to some spectacular places around the globe and through some unforgettable experiences.
   And though I am still practicing playing my trombone daily and occasionally doing some gigs here and there music is not my career anymore. 
   Life has taken some turns in the last 10 years and after working in hospitality, flooring and driving a delivery van it has led to me writing and you reading these lines.</p>
<p>Yes, I'm starting a new journey, a new path wich hopefuly will result in a new career, new job, new experiences and somewhat better life and work balance.</p>
<p><b><i>Confession alert!!!</i></b>
   I'm scared and doubtful and whatever else comes with it all but I also know that I'm not the first one and thousands if not millions of other people have done this before and most probably are doing same thing at the same time as myself so</p>
<b>I'M DETERMENED AND I'LL GET THERE!!!</b></p>    
<p>Thank you for reading and a great day!!!</p>
